# Developer Guide

Overview of the Sicon.OS Platform

## Developing with Sicon

Everything starts with consuming the data from sensors and either visualizing or further processing them.
With standardized protocols, you have access to the data sicon collects. Including devices, parameters, events and historical data.

### Rest API

With the interactive [Rest API](./restapi) documentation, you can quickly create customized visualization or logic.

### MQTT

MQTT serves as event stream to react on sensor data change.
